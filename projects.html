                A client asked for a redesign of a broken site. The site wasn't responsive and had broken css cascade, and lots of bloat. I provided two layouts one complete redo with a video background and a second with similar ui design using mostly bootstrap and cssgradients.
                Little jquery just for a button disabling. Note the submit does not go any where I was not provided with POST information.

                This is an exploration of ChartJs, showing a chart of average income of the bottom 90%. The dataset is taken from WID.world. This uses canvas rather than svg elements.

                This is consumer price index graph built with the D3 Library(Data Driven Documents), it has a mouseover event that shows time and value when you hover over the graph. The Data set is a CSV file, from WDI.world which is parsed by D3 to append SVG elements
                that scale into a div element.
